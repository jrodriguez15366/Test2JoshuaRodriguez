Description:
I set up the repository online and then in my IDE. I had to create a token, so I went to the GitHub website and created one and put in the username and password to save it. After fulling setting up my repository and setting up the files, for GitHub in Eclipse did these things 5 times for each commit.

1.	Create an issue and assign it
2.	Create a branch
3.	Select branch in IDE through Team>Fetch origin, Team>New Branch
4.	Adding test case
5.	Ran Junit test case
6.	If it passed, go to team>commit changes>add comment>commit and push
7.	Go to website and verify the changes and commit them to the main
8.	Repeat process 5 times
For my third commit I forgot to change to my branch, and committed it from the main in Eclipse. I undid the commit in eclipse and did it properly from the branch afterwards.
